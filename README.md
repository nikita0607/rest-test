# REST-TEST

## Getting started

It's a programm for testing REST API. It's so cool programm. I think that.


## Usage Step-by-step

1. Create .yaml file for one test
```yaml
name: testdog!

url: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random

response:
  status: success
```
(See test/test.yaml for more info.)

2. Save this file
3. Run this cool programm
```shell
rest-test FILE_NAME
```
